# tl;dr

Set gifs as background in [i3wm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3).

Run:
```sh
$ ./generate_pngs.sh ~/my_gif.gif
```
and then:
```sh
$ ~/loop_pngs.sh ~/my_gif
```

# Intro

Backgrounds are lovely whether they are gray-scale or rainbow-colored, minimal
or exuberant, low quality or 4K, static or _dynamic_.

-_dynamic_ you say?!

-Aye!

# Animated-background

This is a teeny tiny collection of scripts that allows you to set a gif as a
background. To my knowledge it works fine in
[i3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3) using Xorg. You will have to
install some basic programs to make use of it, although you will probably have
them already installed in your system. There are:

1. [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) - for convert
2. [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) - for setting background

Now, let's make it move!

## Find a gif

Go ahead and find a gif. You'd appreciate a good quality one. I have
included some I found around at
[/gifs](https://github.com/sdaveas/animated-background/tree/master/gifs).
Moving on!

## Set it as background

### Clone it

Business as usual:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sdaveas/animated-background
$ cd animated-background/scripts # (optional)
```

### Chop it

First, execute:
```sh
$ ~/path-to-repo/generate_pngs.sh ~/path-to-gif/awesome.gif
```

This will create a folder under the name `awesome` in the directory from which
you executed `./generate_pngs.sh`. In this case, the folder is at `~/awesome`.
You can do this from anywhere of course, or move it later.

### Loop it

Now that you have all images in a single directory, run:
```
$ ~/path-to-repo/loop_pngs.sh ~/awesome
```
Your background should now be _awesome_ (dot gif).

### Run it silently

If you want to have the animated background to run at, well, the background you
can run it as such:

```sh
$ ~/path-to-repo/loop_pngs.sh ~/awesome &
$ disown && exit
```

If you want to run it when i3 boots up, then add the following line to your `i3/config`:

```
exec --no-startup-id /path-to-repo/animated-background/scripts/loop_pngs.sh ~/awesome
```

### Other usages

If you are not into animation, then you can use the script to simply
update your backgrounds periodically. You can create a folder with your favourite images and run:

```
~/path-to-repo/loop_pngs.sh ~/my_favourite_images 900
```

This will rotate through your images every 15 minutes. You will have not to
worry about performance issues in this case.

# Notes

## Refresh rate

You can optionally change the default refresh rate of by giving a second
argument at `loop_png.sh` like such:

```
$ ./loop_pngs.sh ~/Desktop/forest 0.05
```
This will force the gif to update every 0.05 seconds. The default value is 0.1 seconds.

## Rendering mode

You can optionally change how the wallpaper will be rendered by giving a third argument, just like the example shown below:
```
$ ./loop_pngs.sh ~/Desktop/forest 0.05 f
```
In this case, it will stretch the gif if it ain't the exact proportions of the screen, for instance, if you used a 1366x768
gif in a 1980x1080 monitor it would have black borders in normal mode, however, with f the whole background will be filled (although
some of the image quality might be lost)

## Resource Usage

Bear in mind that using animated background can be computationally intensive,
especially when at frequent refresh! Personally, 0.1 sec refresh rate is OK for
my laptop, but you maybe want to adjust this.

I know that this can be _vastly_ optimized in terms of performance. For now,
since my laptop can handle it without significant performance issues and it is
only 2 commands long, so I use it. Maybe you will also.
